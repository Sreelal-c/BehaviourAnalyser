# BehaviourAnalyser
An Android application to analyse the behaviour of a smartphone user based or his/her usage patterns.
 Through our visual analytic tool, the potential individual smartphone usage patterns are revealed out easily. 
 These results will contribute to the smartphone designers, and human-behaviour experts. 
 Visualizations more successfully encourage users to explore their personal data.
 However, there are not many existing works taking advantage of visual analytics for analysing individual behaviour 
 patterns in human-smartphone interaction logs.
